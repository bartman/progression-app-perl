This repository hosts scripts used to decode `*.progressionbackup` files generated by the fitness tracker called "Progression".

See http://www.progression-app.com/ to learn more about Progression.

# what can I do?

If you export your workouts with Progression, you'll get a `DATE TIME.progressionbackup` file.

There are 2 scripts that can be used to dump the contents of the backup file (everything):

* `./dump.pl <file>` - builds a tree structure that's easy to look at.
* `./dddump.pl <file>` - fairly short, using `Data::Dumper` to generate crude output.

There is also a script that summarizes the workout sessions only.

* `./summary.pl <file>` - it will grow up to be a real tool some day with command line options, and more features.


# what else?

I have a short list of things I'd like to accomplish:

* enumerate workouts (index, date, routine, movements, sets, reps, etc)
* enumerate a workout given an index or date (a table of weight x reps x sets, with any comments)
* generate http://weightxreps.net/ format as output for a given date (with some anotation)
