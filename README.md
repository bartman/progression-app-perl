This repository hosts scripts used to decode `*.progressionbackup` files generated by the fitness tracker called "Progression".

See http://www.progression-app.com/ to learn more about Progression.

# what can I do?

If you export your workouts with Progression, you'll get a `DATE TIME.progressionbackup` file.  You can dump the file into a humanly legilbe format using `dump.pl`.

   ./dump.pl 2015-12-13-21-05-18.progressionbackup | less

# what else?

I have a short list of things I'd like to accomplish:

* enumerate workouts (index, date, routine, movements, sets, reps, etc)
* enumerate a workout given an index or date (a table of weight x reps x sets, with any comments)
* generate http://weightxreps.net/ format as output for a given date (with some anotation)
